# House_price_prediction
This is a Machine Learning based project build using Random Forest Regression to predict the accurate prices of houses with various key features.
This project aims to develop an interactive web platform to simplify real estate decisions for buyers, sellers, and renters. Given the complexity of the housing market, the platform offers customized pages for each user type to input property details like location, size, and conditions. By utilizing machine learning and linear regression, the system predicts accurate property prices based on historical data. This data-driven approach helps users make confident, informed decisions, enhancing the real estate experience with reliable, real-time price predictions.
TECHNOLOGY USED:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional frameworks like Bootstrap)
Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: SQLite 
Machine Learning algorithm: Random Forest Regression
Deployment Tools: Flask server, local hosting.
This project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict house prices based on historical data and property features such as location, square footage, and number of rooms. By implementing the Random Forest Regression model, we achieved reliable and accurate predictions. The model was integrated into a web-based application with dedicated dashboards for buyers, sellers, and tenants, making the system accessible and user-friendly. Overall, the project highlights the importance of data-driven solutions in the real estate sector, enabling more transparent, consistent, and informed decision-making.
